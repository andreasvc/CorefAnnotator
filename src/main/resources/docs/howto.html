<h1>How to annotate</h1>
<h2>By drag and drop</h2>
<p>To create a new entity, first select any segment of text in the text view 
(on the left). With a mouse (or other point device), drag the selection onto 
the top most node in the tree on the right. If you drop the selection, a new 
entity will be created, with a single mention. The entity now appears in the 
tree with a specific color, and the text segment you marked in the text is now
underlined with the same color. The name of the entity will be the same as 
the text segment. Both name and color can be changed at any time.</p>
